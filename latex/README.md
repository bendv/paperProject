## latex directory

This is where the latex subproject lives.

This directory contains two files,
- `paperName.tex`
- `refs.bib`

Only commit these files, ignore the rests (it has been added to the main `.gitignore`)


By the way I use sublime text with the latex package for working on these files. It's by far the best that I have tried so far, with good auto-completion, pretty syntax highlighting (Monokay extended), a nice integration with git (git pluggin), and all awesome sublime text features. But I'll write more about that later.
