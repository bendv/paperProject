## latex directory

This is where the latex subproject lives.

This directory contains two files,
- `paperName.tex`
- `refs.bib`

Only commit these files, ignore the rests (it has been added to the main `.gitignore`). You may consider commiting your pdf, but you should only do so for long term archiving, once the paper has been accepted.

For more info about using latex with git, check out this [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6188780/git-latex-workflow) on stack overflow (and mostly the answer).


By the way I use sublime text with the latex package for working on these files. It's by far the best that I have tried so far, with good auto-completion, pretty syntax highlighting (Monokay extended), key-binding for pdf compilation, a nice integration with git (git pluggin), and all awesome sublime text features. But I'll write more about that later.
